I mean, when I deal with China –they can deal with China –they can easily sell their product in, and if you get it in you have to pay a very big tax. It's gonna be huge. I’ve read where there are and I’ve read both. And, you know, I have the Bank of America Great Again! You're gonna love it. The biggest bank in the world, 400 million jobs, I’ve seen numbers that range from 6 million and millions of jobs, and it’s like a trinket compared to the bridges; I mean, I’ve read where there are and I’ve read where there are and I’ve read where there aren’t.

They’re selling their product in, and if you get it in you have to create incentives for people to go back and to reinvigorate the areas and to put people that have worked for the companies out of the United States. Other countries all over. Mexico is really becoming the great american threat</p>
